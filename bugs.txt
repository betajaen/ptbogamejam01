Bugs:

1. Sometimes you hit an invisible wall, and all die.
	a. Sometimes I can't hold down jump when this happens?
		Left behind! k=-126 x=512 cam=638
		Object died, Player = 0
		
	Looks like it dies because it's out of bounds.

	Left behind! k=-119 x=522 cam=641

	Seems to be related to not being able to jump, then it crashes afterwards. Or seems to crash after releasing jump key.
	But no curves appear.

2. Sometimes it goes to a blue screen.
	a.  I got it when I couldn't hold down jump

3. 
    int sx = playerObject->x - LEVEL->camera;

	Looks wrong. it's in world coords, not screen coords.


TODO:

Player pickups; maybe something simple - as player front tile = 239, then do it- and then have a timer for 4 seconds to have another.
maybe only show the tile on random? dunno. Could store this in the section, and use the seed to determine if it's a cat or not.

Cats should spread out more, maybe just use their index around the centre?
